# Notes for CS240

During this assignment I feel like I've learned a lot about git and markdown. I have used git before but I'm not super confident in it, now I feel like I know the steps to merge conflicts, and to regularly get the newest version from github, edit and send it back to github.
## *The regular steps:*
* **git status**: this will show you if theres changes to pull. if there is, use _git pull_
* **make any changes you want!**
* **git commit -am "comment about what changes I made"**: this will help so you can tell when and where you made mistakes
* **git push**: send it back to the space station!
