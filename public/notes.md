# Notes for CS240

During this assignment I feel like I've learned a lot about git and markdown. I have used git before but I'm not super confident in it, now I feel like I know the steps to merge conflicts, and to regularly get the newest version from github, edit and send it back to github.
## *The regular steps:*
* **git status**: this will show you if theres changes to pull. if there is, use _git pull_
* **make any changes you want!**
* **git commit -am "comment about what changes I made"**: this will help so you can tell when and where you made mistakes
* **git push**: send it back to the space station!

##Notes about HTML:
-HTML is mostly for structure and content of a web page. 
-<a> is for links
-<span> is used for inline styling

##Notes about CSS:
-CSS makes things pretty
-bootstrap and other frameworks can make things a lot easier and simple
-Lots of examples in course content of good setup
-Flex is the goat

##Notes about NODE and EXPRESS
-Use fetch to call external API's 
-index.js file gets called with node and it sets up the live service. an index.js file will declare a port to serve on, declare the place where all the frontend files are. through node, fetch and express a web service is set up.
