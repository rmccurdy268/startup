        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Rhodric </strong></br>Hey Jarrett, I am starting to feel like my current workout plan is no longer aligned with my goals. Can we change it up a little?</p>
        <p><strong>Jarrett </strong></br> Hi Rhodric, great to hear from you. Of course we can switch it up! What do you feel like is going well, and what about the plan would you like to change?</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Rhodric </strong></br>I feel like I'm working too much on my arms. They are starting to get pretty toned, but I feel like my core doesn't get much work.</p>
        <p><strong>Jarrett </strong></br>I'll get a couple core workouts drawn up for you. How often would you like to work on your core? Once/twice/three times a week?</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Rhodric </strong></br>Twice a week seems pretty good. Maybe only once this first week because I might be a little slow to start.</p>
        <p><strong>Jarrett </strong></br>That seems reasonable. For this week I'll switch your back/arms on friday for a back/core workout but you'll still hit arms on thursday. Does that sound alright?</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Rhodric </strong></br>That sounds perfect! Thanks for your help.</p>
        <p><strong>Jarrett </strong></br>Not a problem! I'll reach out next week to solidify your schedule for the next coming weeks. Let me know how that core workout goes and if you have any questions just send them my way.</p>
